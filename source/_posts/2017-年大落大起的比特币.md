2017 年比特币及其它数字货币经历了大落大起，让一部分人先富了起来。与此同时，大多数人对数字货币意见向左，褒贬不一。

看衰的理由：
1. 除技术外缺乏实物、信用支撑。
2. 技术不够完善，仍存在较多问题（交易费用高、确认时间长等）。
3. 交易所和个人钱包容易收到攻击导致货币丢失。
4. 世界多国和地区禁止、限制生产及交易。
5. 价格起伏大，投机者多。
6. 破坏了勤劳致富的价值观，打击了工作的积极性。

看好的理由：
1. 技术手段保证货币总量稳定，交易无法伪造。
2. 逐渐被采用作为支付工具（日本、欧洲等）。
3. 新兴的数字货币交易所涌现，老牌的证券交易所开始运行期货交易（美国、德国等）。
4. 未来用途广泛（智能合约等）。
5. 铸币权重新回到个体手中，未来金融秩序由所有人共同决定。

不成熟的小观点：
- 任何大事物都由小事物发展而来。
- 每个事物都有优势和缺陷。
- 一个小事物能不能成为大事物取决于优势和缺陷的角力。
- 假以时日，一切皆有可能。

## EN VERSION

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency had several dramatic fall and rise in the past year 2017, which made some people rich quickly. Most people, in the meantime, hold defferent opinions on cryptocurrency.

Cons:
1. Lack of support in entity nor credit except technology.
2. Cryptocurrency technology is still need to be perfected in some aspects like high transaction fees and long confirmation time.
3. Cryptocurrency wallets of exchanges and individuals are often attacked, resulting in cryptocurrency loss.
4. Governments in many countries forbid or restrict the production and trade of cryptocurrency.
5. Cryptocurrency prices rise and fall dramatically, with lots of speculators behind.
6. People become unwilling to work hard because of the easy money from cryptocurrency trade.

Pros:
1. Total amount of cryptocurrency is constant because of technology means. Transactions can not be forged.
2. Gradually being adopted as payment method in some countries (Japan, Europe).
3. Can be traded in a variety of exchanges (America, Germany).
4. Lots of possible uses such as smart contract in future.
5. Indivisuals get seigniorage back, decide world financial order together.

My Opinion:
- Anything big comes from small one.
- Anything has pros and cons.
- Anything's development depends on its pros and cons.
- Anything is possible with time.
